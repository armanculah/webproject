# webproject
Welcome!
My name is Arman and this is my repo for my student Web project for the course IT207 at International Burch University Sarajevo. My website is called "Aragon Fragrance" and is about locally made, pure fragrances.

Milestone 1, 23rd of March 2025:
-I have layed out the core architecture of my project, creating frontend and backend folders accordingly
-I have enabled SPApp using https://github.com/amiletti/spapp
-I have created the static frontend for my project, which includes a dashboard, login/signup, browsing page, product page, profile (for admin and for the user) with a table for orders and admin consoles, the cart that leads to the checkout, conected through the index.html.
I have used Bootstrap, but not specifically a template; to fit my needs and not to clutter this project, I have decided to create views and features individually that I will use for the next milestones, I have created different blocks of features all integrated through a common design and stylesheet.
-I have put the ERD diagram for the project in the folder called deliverables, subfolder ERD
